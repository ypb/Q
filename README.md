# What

My [DrFe](http://github.com/ypb/drfe) (notes/GTD app) writ in
[Go](http://golang.org).

## Install

    > goinstall github.com/ypb/gotdb
    > goinstall github.com/ypb/Q

The latter will fail, and you can always `git clone` on your own.
But fix the *tdb* import statement in _main.go_ && `make`; it sucks,
but personally I'm using **GOPATH** and it still doesn't vibe together...

*Q* binary should be self-contained and you can place it anywhere in your
**PATH**s.

## Usage

Not much of Usage for `> ./Q Now`...
